# 📖 Sleepy Dragon, A Single Page App for short stories. 📖

Sleepy Dragon is a mobile single page app that fetches random stories from an API that can be read.

<br> 

This repository contains projects made for the minor Web Design & Development. This repository includes mainly two projects.

### 📱 Single Page App 📱
The single page app is the main project of this repository. The coming sections in this readme all involve the Single Page App.

### 📋 Debrief 📋

During three weeks of the course Web App From Scratch, I will design and develop a Single Page App(SPA) based on a self-chosen user story. This SPA will be based on data fetched from an API.

I will design, build and test a prototype in atleast three iterations. I will write this SPA in vanilla HTML, CSS and JS and will avoid using frameworks and libraries. Micro libraries are allowed in neccessary.

<br>

### ✔️ Personal goals ✔️

For this project I wanted to experiment with API's and go more in depth in using Rive for my project. I also want to store data in local storage so the SPA can remember certain things the user has done.

## 👤 User story 👤

The user story I have chosen for this project is:

> "As a parent, I want to find random short stories to entertain my child before bedtime so I don't have to continiously search for new stories."

<br>

## 🤔 Primary functions 🤔

There are a few primary functions in this app. The user can:

- Read a random story
- Like/save a story
- Read a story that has been saved
- (optional) Use text to speech to have the story read to them
- (optional) Use a dark/light mode
- (optional) Use a search function to find a specific story

## 🐉 Mascot 🐉

The primary audience of this app is children. To make the app more fun and appealing to children, I have created a mascot for the app. The mascot is a dragon that is called Sleepy. The mascot is used in the logo and in the app itself.

<br>

### ✏️ Mascot Sketches ✏️

I made several sketches for the design of the mascot. I wanted the design to be appealing to children and to be fun. I also wanted the design to be simple and not too complex since I will be animating the mascot. I ended up going for a design that has more rounded shapes and a more friendly look.

## 📊 Flowchart 📊

In order to get the structure and functionality of the app properly set up, I created a flowchart that show the different states and functions that can be used.

## 🎞️ Wireframes 🎞️

I made several wireframes for the app. I wanted to make sure that the app was easy to use and that the user could easily find the functions they wanted to use.

The sketches gave me a general idea of where I wanted the interface to go. For more detailed wireframes I used Figma. I made a wireframe for the home page, the story page, saved story page and several states of the app.
