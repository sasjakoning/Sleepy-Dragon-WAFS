## Single Page App
The single page app is the main project of this repository. The coming sections in this readme all involve the Single Page App.

### Debrief

During three weeks of the course Web App From Scratch, I will design and develop a Single Page App(SPA) based on a self-chosen user story. This SPA will be based on data fetched from an API.

I will design, build and test a prototype in atleast three iterations. I will write this SPA in vanilla HTML, CSS and JS and will avoid using frameworks and libraries. Micro libraries are allowed in neccessary.

### Personal goals

For this project I wanted to experiment with API's and go more in depth in using Rive for my project. I also want to store data in local storage so the SPA can remember certain things the user has done.

# Sleepy Dragon, A Single Page App for short stories.

Sleepy Dragon is a mobile single page app that fetches random stories from an API that can be read.

## User story

> As a parent, I want to find random short stories to entertain my child before bedtime so I don't have to continiously search for new stories.

## Primary functions

There are a few primary functions in this app. The user can:

- Read a random story
- Like/save a story
- Read a story that has been saved
- (optional) Use text to speech to have the story read to them
- (optional) Use a dark/light mode
- (optional) Use a search function to find a specific story

## Mascot

The primary audience of this app is children. To make the app more fun and appealing to children, I have created a mascot for the app. The mascot is a dragon that is called Sleepy. The mascot is used in the logo and in the app itself.

### Sketches

I made several sketches for the design of the mascot. I wanted the design to be appealing to children and to be fun. I also wanted the design to be simple and not too complex since I will be animating the mascot. I ended up going for a design that has more rounded shapes and a more friendly look.

## Wireframes

I made several wireframes for the app. I wanted to make sure that the app was easy to use and that the user could easily find the functions they wanted to use.
